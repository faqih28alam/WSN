This project need MQTT as a Protocol. So we choose adafruit broker. We are going to publish data from Nodemcu to MQTT broker. This is the code that we use to publish data to MQTT Adafruit Broker.

To Publish Data to Adafruit MQTT Broker:
1. Connect Device Nodemcu with Sensor (for example we use sensor max30100).
2. Install Board Library.
3. Install Adafruit MQTT Arduino Library (for example we use ESP8266 Adafruit Library).
4. Install Sensor Library if needed.
5. Apply this code.

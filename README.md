# WSN
WSN (Wire Less Network)

The idea of this project is to develop Internet of Things (IoT) Network Layer. We are trying to make NodeMCU ESP32 communicating to others NodeMCU ESP32 via Bluetooh. So NodeMCU ESP32 is like representing nodes as many as possible. Each Nodes will continue forward the data to the others Nodes. The Purpose is to colect the data's sensor from the Area wich not covered by internet connection. After the data were collected, the system would send the data to cloud. The data then will be processed to the mobile application, so the user could control and monitor the data.
